# neural-network-4-in-a-row

This is a neural network python implementation for 4 in a row

Python implementation
four_in_a_row.py - create random games to collect data, train the network, check the accuracy of the model and play againt user

Neural network features:
The input to the network is 6x7 matrix (the board)
The network has two hidden layers with 21 hidden units (configurable)
The output is a 7x1 probability vector for eah column
